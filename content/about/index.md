title: "About"

I am a **science manager and data science/AI expert** working at the intersection of research, technology, and strategy.

I currently serve as **Team Lead and Head of Information & Data Science** at the Helmholtz Association head office. In this role, I work on organizational strategy, data-driven initiatives, and the responsible application of AI across a large research landscape.

In addition, I serve as **Visiting Professor** at the University of Hertfordshire.

Before moving into science management, I led an academic research group as a professor, with a focus on applied machine learning in the life sciences, neuromorphic computing, and machine olfaction / electronic noses.

**Note:** This website previously hosted information about my former academic research group. The group is now closed; the site has been updated to reflect my current role and consultancy work.
