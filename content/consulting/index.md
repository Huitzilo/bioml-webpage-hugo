title: "Consulting"

I advise organizations and teams on high-impact challenges in **data science and AI**, combining deep technical expertise with senior science management experience.

Typical engagements include technical reviews, strategy and readiness work, evaluation and benchmarking, and advisory support for data governance and responsible AI.

I bring hands-on experience in securing academic funding (ca. 3M€) and in reviewing competitive proposals—insight that helps teams design evaluation-ready projects.

I work with research-driven organizations, R&D teams, and public-sector initiatives. If you’d like to explore a collaboration, feel free to get in touch.
