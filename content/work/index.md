## Flagship highlights

### Leading Information & Data Science across Helmholtz (2023–present)
As Head of Information & Data Science at Helmholtz head office, I coordinate strategy and execution across 18 research centres and six research fields, connecting a network of professionals spanning AI, data science, and IT leadership.

### Building an innovation pipeline that secured >20M€ funding
I initiated and led multiple Information & Data Science incubator workshops, resulting in large-scale strategic programmes on **foundation models for scientific research**, **software engineering**, and **benchmarking**.

### European flagship leadership: EU Human Brain Project (2014–2023)
PI / Work Package leader / Task leader across multiple phases of the Human Brain Project, with leadership responsibilities for applications and benchmarks in neuromorphic computing.

### Machine olfaction at the speed of biology (Science Advances, 2024)
Work demonstrating high-speed odor sensing using a miniaturized electronic nose — relevant to sensing, robotics, and real-world ML under drift and noise.

### Limits of generalization in neuromorphic olfaction (Nature Machine Intelligence, 2024)
Work outlining limitations in odor recognition and generalization in a neuromorphic olfactory circuit — relevant to robustness, evaluation, and out-of-distribution generalization.

### Expert roles and international visibility
Invited expert to the Scientific Advisory Board of the **Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)** and speaker at 80+ invited talks, seminars, and keynotes.
